# Agent Executor Lambda

This Lambda will use AWS Polly to check in with the elderly upon detecting an incident. Future extensions can integrate transcribe to receive the elderly's input to use as feedback to decide if the elderly is okay and doesn't require attention, or whether further action needs to be taken (e.g. calling an ambulance).
